# Feature Specification: Enhanced Emergency Response API

**Feature Branch**: `001-enhanced-emergency-api`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhance the emergency response API endpoints to support advanced panic button functionality with automatic location accuracy, medical information retrieval, real-time status updates, and family notification systems. The API should handle offline sync capabilities, provide WebSocket real-time updates via Redis, store emergency data securely in PostgreSQL with proper encryption, and integrate with external emergency services. Include proper authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging for all emergency-related endpoints."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Advanced Panic Button Activation (Priority: P1)

A community member in distress activates the panic button on their mobile device. The system automatically captures their precise location using GPS, retrieves their medical information from their profile, immediately notifies emergency responders and family contacts, and provides real-time status updates throughout the emergency response process.

**Why this priority**: This is the core emergency response functionality that directly impacts community safety and must work reliably during critical situations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a panic button activation with location data, verifying medical information retrieval, and confirming all notifications are sent within 5 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a registered device with valid location permissions, **When** they activate the panic button, **Then** the system captures their GPS coordinates with accuracy within 10 meters and creates an incident within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a panic button activation occurs, **When** the system processes the emergency, **Then** it automatically retrieves the user's medical information (allergies, conditions, medications) and includes it in the incident data
3. **Given** an emergency incident is created, **When** the system processes notifications, **Then** it immediately sends alerts to emergency responders, family contacts, and community leaders within 5 seconds
4. **Given** a panic button activation occurs during load shedding, **When** the device has poor connectivity, **Then** the system stores the incident locally and syncs when connectivity is restored

---

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Status Updates (Priority: P1)

Emergency responders and family members receive real-time updates about incident status changes, responder assignments, and resolution progress through WebSocket connections and push notifications.

**Why this priority**: Real-time communication is critical for effective emergency response coordination and keeping all stakeholders informed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an incident and verifying that all connected clients receive real-time updates when the incident status changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an incident is created, **When** a responder acknowledges it, **Then** all connected clients receive a real-time update via WebSocket within 1 second
2. **Given** family members are monitoring an incident, **When** the incident status changes to resolved, **Then** they receive push notifications in their preferred language (English/Afrikaans)
3. **Given** multiple responders are connected to the system, **When** an incident is assigned to a specific responder, **Then** only the assigned responder receives assignment notifications

---

### User Story 3 - Offline Sync Capabilities (Priority: P2)

The system maintains full emergency functionality during network outages, load shedding, or poor connectivity by storing incidents locally and syncing when connectivity is restored.

**Why this priority**: South African communities frequently experience load shedding and connectivity issues, making offline capability essential for emergency response.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating network disconnection, creating incidents offline, and verifying they sync correctly when connectivity returns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a device is offline, **When** a user activates the panic button, **Then** the incident is stored locally with timestamp and location data
2. **Given** offline incidents are stored locally, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** all pending incidents sync to the server within 30 seconds
3. **Given** multiple offline incidents exist, **When** syncing occurs, **Then** incidents are processed in chronological order and duplicate prevention is enforced

---

### User Story 4 - Family Notification System (Priority: P2)

Family members and emergency contacts receive immediate notifications about their loved one's emergency situation with appropriate context and follow-up instructions.

**Why this priority**: Family notification provides emotional support and ensures additional help can be mobilized quickly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an incident and verifying that all configured emergency contacts receive appropriate notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has configured emergency contacts, **When** they activate the panic button, **Then** all active emergency contacts receive SMS and push notifications within 5 seconds
2. **Given** family members receive emergency notifications, **When** they respond to the notification, **Then** their response is logged and shared with emergency responders
3. **Given** emergency contacts have different communication preferences, **When** notifications are sent, **Then** each contact receives notifications via their preferred method (SMS, email, push)

---

### User Story 5 - External Emergency Service Integration (Priority: P3)

The system integrates with external emergency services (police, medical, fire) to automatically dispatch appropriate responders based on incident type and location.

**Why this priority**: Integration with official emergency services ensures comprehensive emergency response coverage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating different types of incidents and verifying that appropriate external services are notified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a medical emergency is reported, **When** the incident is processed, **Then** the system automatically notifies local medical services with patient medical information
2. **Given** a security incident is reported, **When** the incident is processed, **Then** the system automatically notifies local police with location and context information
3. **Given** external services are notified, **When** they respond with status updates, **Then** the system updates the incident with external service response information
