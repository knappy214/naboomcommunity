# Tasks: Enhanced Emergency Response API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-enhanced-emergency-api/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as they are critical for emergency response functionality where reliability is paramount.

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Django project**: `panic/` (existing module), `naboomcommunity/` (project root)
- **Models**: `panic/models/`
- **API**: `panic/api/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for real-time updates
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for offline panic button
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for family notifications
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for external dispatch

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for enhanced panic button API in panic/tests/test_enhanced_panic_api.py"
Task: "Integration test for panic button with location accuracy in panic/tests/test_location_accuracy.py"
Task: "Integration test for medical information retrieval in panic/tests/test_medical_integration.py"
Task: "Integration test for emergency notifications in panic/tests/test_emergency_notifications.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create EmergencyLocation model in panic/models/emergency_location.py"
Task: "Create EmergencyMedical model in panic/models/emergency_medical.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Enhanced Panic Button)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Real-Time Updates)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Offline Sync)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Family Notifications)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (External Integration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 97 tasks across 8 phases
- **Setup**: 7 tasks
- **Foundational**: 13 tasks (CRITICAL - blocks all user stories) - **UPDATED: Added WCAG compliance, Redis DB config, WebSocket scalability, USSD integration**
- **User Story 1**: 13 tasks (Enhanced Panic Button - MVP)
- **User Story 2**: 7 tasks (Real-Time Updates)
- **User Story 3**: 7 tasks (Offline Sync)
- **User Story 4**: 7 tasks (Family Notifications)
- **User Story 5**: 9 tasks (External Integration)
- **Polish**: 20 tasks (Cross-cutting concerns) - **UPDATED: Moved WCAG compliance to Foundational**

**Parallel Opportunities**: 51 tasks can run in parallel
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear, independent test criteria
**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Enhanced Panic Button) - 13 tasks

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- ‚úÖ WCAG compliance moved to Foundational phase (T017)
- ‚úÖ USSD integration added (T020)
