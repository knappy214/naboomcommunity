# Speckit Community Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Community-First Platform
Every feature MUST prioritize resident safety and emergency response capabilities. The platform serves the community's needs above technical possibilities. All development decisions must be evaluated against their impact on community safety, accessibility, and engagement. Emergency features take absolute priority over non-essential functionality.

### II. Accessibility-First Design
All interfaces MUST follow WCAG guidelines and be accessible to all community members including elderly and disabled residents. Design must accommodate basic smartphones with poor connectivity, minimal learning curves for non-technical users, and support for all South African language groups. Mobile-first approach is mandatory.

### III. Privacy-First Data Protection
Zero-tolerance privacy policy protecting personal and emergency data. All personal information, medical data, and emergency contacts must be encrypted and protected with the highest security standards. Data collection must be minimal, purposeful, and transparent. GDPR compliance is mandatory.

### IV. Offline-Capable Emergency Features
Critical emergency features MUST function during load shedding scenarios and poor connectivity. Panic button functionality, emergency contact systems, and essential safety features must work offline. Local data caching and sync capabilities are required for all emergency-related functionality.

### V. Multilingual Support
English and Afrikaans support is mandatory as standard requirement. All user interfaces, emergency communications, and community features must be available in both languages. Language preferences must be respected throughout the platform. Future language additions must not compromise existing functionality.

### VI. User-Driven Feature Development
Features MUST be developed based on actual community needs rather than technical possibilities. Community feedback drives all development priorities. Regular user testing with actual community members is required. Technical complexity must be justified by clear community benefit.

### VII. Sustainable Technology Choices
Technology stack MUST be maintainable by small development teams without vendor lock-in. Open-source solutions preferred. Minimal dependencies and clear upgrade paths required. All technology choices must be sustainable for long-term community ownership and maintenance.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and technical decisions. Amendments require:
