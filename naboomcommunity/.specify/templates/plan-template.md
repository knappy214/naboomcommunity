# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Community-First Platform Compliance
- [ ] Feature prioritizes resident safety and emergency response capabilities
- [ ] Development decision evaluated against community safety impact
- [ ] Emergency features take priority over non-essential functionality

### Accessibility-First Design Compliance
- [ ] Interface follows WCAG guidelines for all community members
- [ ] Design accommodates basic smartphones with poor connectivity
- [ ] Minimal learning curve for non-technical users
- [ ] Mobile-first approach implemented

### Privacy-First Data Protection Compliance
- [ ] Zero-tolerance privacy policy for personal and emergency data
- [ ] Data collection is minimal, purposeful, and transparent
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified

### Offline-Capable Emergency Features Compliance
- [ ] Critical emergency features function during load shedding scenarios
- [ ] Panic button functionality works offline
- [ ] Local data caching and sync capabilities implemented

### Multilingual Support Compliance
- [ ] English and Afrikaans support implemented
- [ ] Language preferences respected throughout platform
- [ ] Future language additions don't compromise existing functionality

### User-Driven Feature Development Compliance
- [ ] Feature based on actual community needs, not technical possibilities
- [ ] Community feedback drives development priorities
- [ ] Technical complexity justified by clear community benefit

### Sustainable Technology Choices Compliance
- [ ] Technology maintainable by small development teams
- [ ] No vendor lock-in dependencies
- [ ] Open-source solutions preferred where possible

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
